        <h1>CARBONARA</h1>
        <img src="./carbonara.jpeg">
        <p><strong><em>Descripton</em></strong></p>
        <p>The ingredients are simple—just spaghetti (or another 
          long pasta), and the carbonara is made with pancetta or bacon, 
          eggs, 
          Parmesan, a little olive oil, salt and pepper.</p> 
          <p>The silky carbonara sauce is created when the beaten 
            eggs are tossed with the hot pasta and a little fat 
            from the pancetta or bacon.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>
          
          <ul>
            
              <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
               <li> 1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
                <li>1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional) </li>
              <li>  3-4 whole eggs </li>
              <li> 1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
              <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
              <li>Salt and black pepper to taste </li>
              
          </ul>
          <p><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></p>
          <ol><li>
            <p>Heat pasta water:</p>

            Put a large pot of salted water on to boil 
            (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.) </li>
              <li> <p>Sauté pancetta/bacon and garlic:</p>

                While the water is coming to a boil, heat 
                the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over 
                medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly 
                until crispy.
                
                Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then 
                turn off the heat and put the pancetta and 
                garlic into a large bowl. </li>
              
              <li> <p>Beat eggs and half of the cheese:</p>

                In a small bowl, beat the eggs 
                and mix in about half of the cheese. </li>
                <li> <p>Cook pasta:</p>

                  Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, 
                  and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil. 
                </li>
                <li> <p>Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon:</p>

                  When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, 
                  not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with 
                  the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve 
                  some of the pasta water.
                  
                  Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly,
                   as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the
                    pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create 
                    a creamy sauce.
                  
                  Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool 
                  just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when 
                  you mix them in. 
                  (That's the tricky part.) </li>
                  <li><p>Add the beaten egg mixture: </p>Add the beaten 
                    eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once 
                    more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to 
                    the pasta to keep it 
                    from drying out. </li>
                    <li>Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and 
                      freshly ground black pepper. If you want, sprinkle with a 
                      little fresh chopped parsley. </li>
        </ol>
